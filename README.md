Deformation Field Driven Triplanar MRI Reconstruction

We directly superimposed and fused the transverse, sagittal, and coronal planes, but the resulting fused images exhibited spatial misalignment and blurred boundaries. However, after applying 3D spatial deformation field correction and then performing the fusion, the image boundaries became clear, and the lesion features became more prominent.
